The tournament will have two sections like the Spring Open does but will have the higher prize fund that was planned for the original Neil Dale Memorial. Neil volunteered countless hours to chess, including running hundreds of tournaments over many decades. We hope everyone can stop by to pay their respects and share some memories of Neil before the start of round 1. See an obituary of Neil here and a remembrance of Neil in the February edition of the Northwest Chess Magazine here. More information about the tournament coming soon."),
